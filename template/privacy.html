                    <h2>Privacy Policy for IITC-CE Applications</h2>

                    <div class="metadata">
                        <strong>Effective Date:</strong> 29 August 2025<br>
                        <strong>Last Updated:</strong> 29 August 2025
                    </div>

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all IITC-CE applications, including IITC Mobile and IITC Prime.</p>
                    <p>IITC-CE ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with our applications.</p>

                    <h3>Data Collection by IITC-CE Applications</h3>
                    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or user information.</strong></p>

                    <p>IITC-CE applications function as enhanced web browsers that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Load intel.ingress.com (Niantic's official Ingress Intel website) in a webview</li>
                        <li>Apply userscripts to enhance the interface with additional features</li>
                        <li>Do not collect any personal information from users</li>
                        <li>Do not store user data on our servers</li>
                        <li>Do not track user behavior or usage patterns</li>
                        <li>Do not require user accounts or registration</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>How IITC-CE Applications Work</h3>
                    <p>IITC-CE applications are specialized browsers that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Display intel.ingress.com with enhanced userscripts running in the webpage context</li>
                        <li>May download userscript updates from our server at iitc.app (which only serves static files and does not log users)</li>
                        <li>May cache web resources temporarily on your device for performance</li>
                        <li>May request standard device permissions for functionality (data remains on your device)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="card-panel important">
                        <strong>Important:</strong> The userscripts work within the webpage like any JavaScript code - they do not intercept network traffic or modify data transmission.
                    </div>

                    <h3>Third-Party Services - Ingress Intel</h3>
